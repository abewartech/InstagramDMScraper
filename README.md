### Instagram DM Scraper

## Description
This little script scrapes every private message with any user. You can either just read it in the console or export the chats to a text file to have it saved

## How to start
- You need to have Python 3.x installed in your system
- Download the source code (Either from releases or master branch)
- Install the requirements for the script to work (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Next, you need the sessionid of the account you're trying to scrape from
- Once you have all that, just following the script's steps should get you where you need

## Features
- See all DMs the user has
- Fetch all messages from any DM chat
- Fetch only messages more recent that specified date (optional)
- Export fetched messages to text file

## What's the sessionid?
The sessionid is a cookie that the Instagram website stores in your browser when there's an account logged in it. Everytime the user logs out and logins again the sessionid changes
