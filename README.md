### Instagram DM Scraper

## Description
This little script scrapes every private message with any user. You can either just read it in the console or export the chats to a text file to have it saved

## How to start
- You need to have Python 3.x installed in your system
- Download the source code (Either from releases or master branch)
- Install the requirements for the script to work (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
- Next, you need the sessionid of the account you're trying to scrape from
- Once you have all that, just following the script's steps should get you where you need
